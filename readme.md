## Smart Plantation System ##
<p> In this project I had made an autonomous plantation system that can help farmers to grow various crops and even without their season. This was like you can grow and care plants without human need.

It was completely automated and designed to be used in a variety of application like growing of crops of plants and even in the house garden. </p>

# Features #
<h3> Lightning control </h3>
<p>It was capable of the control of the light that a plant need. A LDR sensor was implemented which on or off light on a specific predefined light level according to the plant needs. </p>

<h3>Automated watering </h3>
<p> Checks the mooisture level of the soil every 15 minutes and if the moisture level falls below the minimum threshold value set then it automatically commant the water motor to turn on and when the moisture reached the needed moisture level the the water pump will automatically turn off.</p>

<h3> Countinuous Temperature Monitoring </h3>
<p> A dedicated and highly accurate DHT sensor was implemented the monitors the temperature continuously and blink the red or green light accordingly. This will be very helpful for the plants that need a specific temperature to be maintained and also are made for some other climate and grown in some other climate.</p>

<h3> Continuous Humidity monitoring </h3>
<p> The same DHT sensor is also used for the continuous humidity monitoring.This will be helpful to inform the plant owner that the humidity level to be changed either by spraying water or to shifting the small plants somewhere else.</p>

<h2> All these things helps a plant to grow faster and at diverse climates. This also reduce the efforts of the owner of the farmer to grow various crops and generate a huge income or the growing of some non season fruits.</h2>

<h3>This technology is also very cheap and can be used by the farmers of the planters who cannot afford the cost of various monitoring technologies that are available in the market. </h3>
